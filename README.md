# How to use
Clone the repository, or download the source files to a directory on your computer. Then you need to edit the index.js file that is in the downloaded folder. Change line #22 to be your lastFM username. You can then launch the script by navigating to the directory you downloaded. First you need to download the required modules and set them up. You do this by typing:
> npm install

Then you can run:
> node index.js

in the downloaded directory to start the app.
